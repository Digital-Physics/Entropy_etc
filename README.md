# Entropy_etc
Entropy, Cross-Entropy, K-L Divergence, Huffman Coding

This code is educational in nature.  It tries to give people more intuition for the relationship between entropy, cross-entropy, K-L Divergence, and Huffman Coding.  It also has a few functions.  One function generates Huffman code, another is an encoder, and finally a decoder function.
